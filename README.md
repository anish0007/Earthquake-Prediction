## Earthquake-Prediction
This repository is associated with various machine learning and optimization techniques used for the prediction of earthquakes. Various methods are applied taking the raw fields of the original dataset as well as certain useful features extracted from the original dataset as input to the various machine learning models.It was observed that the results improved when the features extracted from the original dataset were used as input to those machine learning models than when the raw fields of the original data were used for the same purpose.
## Description of various datasets 
#### database_original.csv
This dataset was taken from Kaggle and the url link for the same is https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database. All the input fields of the dataset are well described at the mentioned link above.
#### Dataset.csv
As mentioned earlier various features were extracted from the original dataset. These features are same as those mentioned in the research paper titled "NEURAL NETWORK MODELS FOR EARTHQUAKE MAGNITUDE PREDICTION USING MULTIPLE SEISMICITY INDICATORS" by Ashif Panakkat and Hojjat Adeli. The details of all these features can be well understood from the same paper in this repsitory i.e., "panakkat2007.pdf".

## Earthquake-Prediction
This repository is associated with various machine learning and optimization techniques used for the prediction of earthquakes. Various methods are applied taking the raw fields of the original dataset as well as certain useful features extracted from the original dataset as input to the various machine learning models.It was observed that the results improved when the features extracted from the original dataset were used as input to those machine learning models than when the raw fields of the original data were used for the same purpose.
